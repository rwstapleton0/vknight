# Captain Vee

these are the test programs from the vtuber knight named 'Captain Vee.'

wooden helmet is included, as no knight should let another wear his helm.

## Rational:

email me.

## Notes:

got googles mediapipe working which does all the heavy lifting, now just need to map it to some animations. going to use pygame? some 2d python game engine, something with a useful toolset to control these elements.


- face landmarking for video is working
- next to create the anims and do the other end of work
- Then get them to meet in the middle?

## Display Engine Checklist

- Good sprite animation 
- Clear bg to block color or transparent
- 


### Pygame
